    <p>It all started with a question: <em>is this coronary artery dimension normal?</em></p>
    <p>That turned into a spreadsheet (before Excel was a thing), which turned into a wep page (before there were mobile devices), which turned into a domain (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.parameterz.com">www.parameterz.com</a>). </p>    
    <p>Mine is a special brand of laziness. I would rather spend hours of time up front building a tool that will help save me moments of time on the backside of every echo. 
    <p>
        These are some of those tools.
